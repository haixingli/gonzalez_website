        <h1 class="text-center">Single-Molecule Biophysics</h1>

        <p> Our group uses single-molecule biophysical approaches to investigate the molecular mechanism of one of Nature's most fundamental and conserved cellular processes: protein synthesis by the ribosome. The ribosome is the RNA-based molecular machine that is universally responsible for translating the nucleotide sequence provided by messenger RNAs into the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein products. As such, the ribosome plays a critical role in the mechanism and regulation of gene expression and is the target of numerous cellular protein factors that regulate protein synthesis, small-molecule antibiotic drugs that block protein synthesis, and human viral pathogens that commandeer the process of protein synthesis for their own purposes. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the conformational dynamics of the ribosome, its aminoacyl-transfer RNA substrates, and its essential protein factors in real time, as they carry out the process of protein synthesis. By integrating the dynamic information that is uniquely available from the single-molecule resolution of our experiments into contemporary structural and biochemical models for protein synthesis, we gain insights into the molecular mechanism of protein synthesis and its regulation that are simply not accessible using traditional ensemble biophysical and biochemical approaches. </p>

        <p>An important aspect of research in our group is the ongoing development of new experimental tools that empower single-molecule biophysical studies of complex biological processes such as protein synthesis. For example, we are applying microfluidic technologies to expand the experimental conditions under which we can perform single-molecule fluorescence experiments; optical imaging technologies to increase the information content of our experiments; nanotechnologies to establish entirely new, non-fluorescence based single-molecule detection schemes; and statistical inference approaches to develop algorithms for the statistically rigorous analysis of single-molecule dynamics data. As a result, research in our group is highly interdisciplinary, drawing from the fields of biophysical chemistry, biochemistry, computational biology, physics, and engineering to address complex biological problems that are not easily addressed through any one individual discipline.</p>

        <h2> Details </h2>

        <p>Gene expression and its control are inextricably tied to every biochemical event in all living cells. As such, deregulation of gene expression is associated with numerous human diseases, most notably cancer and viral infections. Gene expression and its regulation are mediated by complex biomolecular assemblies known as RNA polymerase, the spliceosome and the ribosome. These act as molecular motors in the biochemical processes of transcription, splicing and protein synthesis respectively. Our research focuses on the thermodynamics, kinetics and structures of these biomolecular assemblies and molecular motors, with specific emphasis on the ribosome and protein synthesis.</p>

        <p>As a molecular motor, the ribosome and its substrates undergo numerous highly-coordinated, transient molecular motions during protein synthesis; the process is necessarily dynamic. Nevertheless, dynamic information is lacking in current mechanistic models of protein synthesis. For example, the sequence, cooperativity and lifetimes of substrate binding events are poorly defined. In addition, the transient dynamic nature of crucial structural intermediates has impeded study of their role in protein synthesis. Coordinated conformational rearrangements of the ribosome and its substrates, possibly important for allosteric signaling, have also not been kinetically characterized. Research addressing these dynamic aspects is critical for establishing a complete mechanistic model and providing a full understanding of protein synthesis and its regulation. To explore the dynamics of protein synthesis, we take a variety of biochemical, kinetic and structural approaches, making particularly extensive use of single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy.</p>

        <p>The kinetics of substrate binding in a complex biochemical reaction can be easily followed using fluorescently labeled substrates and single-molecule fluorescence. Also, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is uniquely suited to bridge the gaps between static structure, conformational dynamics and biochemical function. The efficiency of smFRET depends on the distance between a donor and acceptor dye-pair and can therefore be used to monitor conformational changes by measuring changes in distance between donor and acceptor dyes as a function of time. By eliminating ensemble-averaging, single-molecule experiments allow study of the distributions and time trajectories of physical properties, such as composition and conformational state, which would ordinarily remain masked in bulk. In addition, biochemical reactions that are difficult or impossible to synchronize when studied in bulk can be effectively studied using single-molecule experiments. Finally, single-molecule fluorescence allows investigation of kinetics on a milliseconds timescale, matching the expected timescale of conformational rearrangements of the ribosome and its substrates.</p>

        <p>A complete mechanistic understanding of the ribosomal molecular machine and its role in carrying out and regulating protein synthesis will serve as a paradigm for understanding related molecular machines and biomolecular assemblies involved in other aspects of gene expression and its regulation.</p>
