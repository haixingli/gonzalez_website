        <h2>Postdoctoral Researchers</h2>
        <p>The Gonzalez Group currently has positions available for highly motivated individuals with strong backgrounds in biophysical chemistry or biochemistry. We are particularly interested in applicants with expertise in the biophysical chemistry or biochemistry of RNA or with experience in the single-molecule spectroscopy or microscopy of biomolecules. In addition, there is a joint postdoctoral position available between the Gonzalez Group and the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/fac-bios/cornish/group/index.html">Cornish Group</a>, in the Department of Chemistry, for applicants interested in investigating the amino acid specificity of the cellular protein synthetic machinery. If you are interested in joining the Gonzalez Group please send a cover letter describing your current research interests and future career goals, your current curriculum vitae including a list of publications, a statement of your research accomplishments, and contact information for three references to <a href="mailto:rlg2118@columbia.edu">Professor Gonzalez via email</a> or at the following address:</p>
        <address class="text-center">
          Columbia University<br/>

        </address>

        <h2>Graduate Student Researchers</h2>
        <p>The Gonzalez Group is always looking for highly talented and motivated graduate students interested in the biophysical chemistry and biochemistry of biomolecular machines and desiring intensive training in state-of-the-art single-molecule spectroscopies and microscopies. In addition, there are joint graduate student positions available between the Gonzalez Group and the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/fac-bios/cornish/group/index.html">Cornish Group</a>, in the Department of Chemistry, for graduate students interested in the amino acid specificity of the cellular protein synthetic machinery. Likewise, there are joint graduate student positions available between the Gonzalez Group and the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~chw2/">Wiggins Group</a>, in the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, for graduate students interested in the statistical inference of kinetic models from single-molecule time series data. Prospective Columbia graduate students interested in joining the Gonzalez Group should apply to the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/grad/admis/index.html">Department of Chemistry's Graduate Program</a> and contact <a href="mailto:rlg2118@columbia.edu">Professor Gonzalez via email</a>. Current Columbia graduate students interested in joining our research group should contact <a href="mailto:rlg2118@columbia.edu">Professor Gonzalez via email</a>.</p>

        <h2>Undergraduate Student Researchers</h2>
        <p>There are always ongoing opportunities available in the Gonzalez Group for highly motivated undergraduate students interested in pursuing research in the areas of biophysical chemistry, biochemistry, and/or single-molecule spectroscopy and microscopy. Depending on research interests and experience, undergraduate student researchers may be paired with a senior graduate student/postdoctoral researcher on a project of mutual interest or may pursue an independent research project. The Gonzalez Group also typically accepts 1-2 summer undergraduate student researchers through the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/undergrad/REU/index.html"> Department of Chemistry's National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (NSF-REU) Program</a> or the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/ug/surf/"> Department of Biological Sciences' Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) Program</a>. Undergraduate students interested in pursuing research opportunities in the Gonzalez Group should contact <a href="mailto:rlg2118@columbia.edu">Professor Gonzalez via email</a>.</p>
