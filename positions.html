                <h2>Postdoctoral Researchers</h2>
                <p>
                  The Gonzalez Group currently has positions available for highly motivated individuals with strong backgrounds in biophysical chemistry or biochemistry. We are particularly interested in applicants with expertise in the biophysical chemistry or biochemistry of RNA or with experience in the single-molecule spectroscopy or microscopy of biomolecules. In addition, there are joint postdoctoral positions available between the Gonzalez Group and any one of several of our collaborators' research groups. If you are interested in joining the Gonzalez Group please send a cover letter describing your current research interests and future career goals, your current curriculum vitae including a list of publications, a statement of your research accomplishments, and contact information for three references to <a href="mailto:rlg2118@columbia.edu">Professor Gonzalez via email</a> or at the following address:
